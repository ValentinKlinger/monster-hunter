# monster-hunter

The goal of this turn based game is that you have to kill as many monsters as possible. You will face the monsters one by one and each time you defeat one, the next one will be a little stronger and so will you.
To defeat them you have two attacks and a shield.
The first attack does simple damage.
The second one does more damage but it has a cooldown.
The shield will increase with each turn and once it is activated, the next attack you take will be decreased by 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% depending on how long you have recharged it.
